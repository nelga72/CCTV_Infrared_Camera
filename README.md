### Introduction 
This project was conducted in June - July, 2018 using a homemade modified digital camera able to detect near-infrared (NIR) light. It aimed to uncover and visualize the actual extent of operability of public Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance cameras that emit NIR to be able to 'see' at night and produce usable images.  

The data produced in this study is inteneded only for education purposes.
